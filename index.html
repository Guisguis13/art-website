                This is where I will put in some historical info about Dad's art. Like when did
                Dad start drawing, why he started drawing (self-expression, a way to relax,
                a way to show love? etc etc). Just have dad use his own words and express himself
                into the history of what and why. I'm looking for an artistic history not the
                where, when, how. Makes sense? Probably not lol.
