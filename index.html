                Welcome and Thank You for visiting Vance Heslin Artistry. Vance's 
                Gallery primarily contains Indigenous Artwork commonly composed of
                Black and White artwork. Always having a nack for beautiful geometric 
                designs, Vance decided it was the perfect way to bring his imagined 
                scenes together. Please take the time to enjoy his collection and 
                learn a little about this small town artist.

                Vance was born in Montreal on July 9th 1969. Growing up, he spent
                 most of his time in Ontario southern with his Mother and 6 sisters. 
                 He met his loving wife Cyndy in 1994 and married her the following 
                 year and at the same time added Justin to his family. Shortly after 
                 Vance had two more children named Tyler and Jared. Soon after Jared 
                 was born in 1999 his blooming family moved out west to the small 
                 village of Holden in 2003. In 2008 his family moved to Ryley where 
                 he lives now with only his wife of more than 25 years after all his 
                 kids have grown up and moved out.

                Vance started drawing in 7th Grade as just doodles on his unfinished 
                school work. But has progressed over time into beautifully drawn love 
                letters to scathing renditions of unpopular teachers. Into this early 
                adult years life took its toll on Vance's free time to draw and only 
                came back to it just before he met his Wife. He loves to take his to 
                time with his artwork, a true labour of love with many painstaking 
                hours to create his artwork. Now with retirement just around the 
                corner, he has not only the free time but the inspiration that only 
                comes with maturity and wisdom.

                        Vance's art as described earlier is Primarily Black and White 
                        Traditional Indigenous artwork. His technique is very thorough and 
                        farsighted.

                Laying out the drawing to scale in pencil and gets more and more 
                detailed as the drawing progresses. After all the lines are drawn 
                and the details filled, Vance uses a variety of markers of different
                densities and thickness to finish the artwork.

                The question all artists are asked and is probably to hardest to 
                answer for many is, why do you draw? Why do you love it so much? For 
                Vance, it's an easy answer... "Because I like to!" In all seriousness, 
                he loves creating art as a way of self-expression. To produce art he is 
                passionate. To give each creation his heart. His happiness, his wonder, 
                his sadness and his love.
